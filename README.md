# Data-Analytics-Summer-14
Summer 2014 Data Analytics Project

Last summer I worked as a data visualizaiton intern at for the Energy and Resources Group at UC Berkeley. I was involved with their "Information-Energy Nexus Research Project".

The aim of the project was to plot countywise energy consumption data on California's map and attempt to discover common trends. It was an exciting project and I learnt a lot. 

The main source of data for this work is the Residential Applicance Saturation Study, funded and administered by the California Energy Commission in 2009. We were allowed access to the data on request as it is not freely available to the public.

In this repository I have included the original R-code .rmd file as well as the generated output in PDF format.
